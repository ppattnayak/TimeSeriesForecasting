## What is Time Series Analysis? And why is it required?
‘Time’ is the most important factor which ensures success in a business. It’s difficult to keep up with the pace of time. But, technology has developed some powerful methods using which we can ‘see things’ ahead of time. One such method, which deals with time based data is Time Series Modeling. As the name suggests, it involves working on time (years, days, hours, minutes) based data, to derive hidden insights to make informed decision making.

Time series models are very useful models when you have serially correlated data. Most of business houses work on time series data to analyze sales number for the next year, website traffic, competition position and much more.

## Scope of this Project
This project will provide a step-by-step guide for fitting an **ARIMA** model using R. ARIMA models are a popular and flexible class of forecasting model that utilize historical information to make predictions. This type of model is a basic forecasting technique that can be used as a foundation for more complex models. In this project, we walk through an example of examining time series for predicting domestic auto sales for 2018 in US, fitting an ARIMA model, and creating a basic forecast.
